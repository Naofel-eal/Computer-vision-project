# Blur generator
## Description
This project is a Python-based software that takes an image or video as input. It uses a custom-trained YOLOv8n model to detect faces within the given input. Once the faces are detected, the user is given the option to blur the identified faces. This software can be used for privacy protection purposes, allowing users to anonymize faces in photos or videos with ease.
Used dataset: [Face detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fareselmenshawii/face-detection-dataset/data)
The model weights can be found in de `weights` folder.
